##  Submission Guidelines:
- Local addons are intended to provide small but meaningful adjustments/improvements to a player's experience. **They should not change the core Portal 2 game/campaign in a huge, drastic way.**
- Local addons should be performant on most player's systems, t**hey should not include any performance-heavy features.** _(This mainly only applies to submissions which make use of VScript in some way)._
- **No new maps/campaigns, PBR asset packs, etc.**
- The total file size of local addons shouldn't be any larger than it needs to be. **This means all local addons must be effectively cleaned up of any unused/unneeded assets before submission.**

Addons which do not meet these guidelines may be declined. You are always welcome to upload your addon to the [P2:CE Steam Workshop.](https://steamcommunity.com/app/440000/workshop/)

_**In cases where a submitted addon is very similar to one already included in P2:CE, we may merge it's features into the existing addon rather than include it separately. We reserve the right to decline any addon submissions which we feel wouldn't be suitable to be included in the game.**_
